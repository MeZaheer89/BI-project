# ðŸ“ˆ Business Analytics & Causal Inference
- Causal Inference on Observational Data: Developed DAGs and identified causal effects using backdoor/front-door criteria and do-calculus; performed structure learning (PC algorithm) and sensitivity analysis using Python (DoWhy, causal-learn).

- A/B Testing at Streaming Service: Conducted randomization checks, power analysis, group comparisons, CUPED variance reduction, Bayesian A/B testing, and CATE estimation using regression and logistic models.

- Confounded Impact of Push Notifications: Estimated causal effects using regression, propensity score matching, inverse probability weighting, double-robust methods, and IV estimation (2SLS); evaluated robustness against unobserved confounding.

- Double Machine Learning for Mobile App: Implemented DML (Partial Linear & AIPW), estimated ATEs and HTEs with Causal Forests, R-/DR-Learners; evaluated model performance and learned optimal policy for notification targeting.
